## Introduction
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a powerful language that enhances the appearance and layout of web pages. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer looking to refresh your CSS skills, this article will guide you through a comprehensive review of CSS selectors, properties, and layout techniques. By the end, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to style and structure your web pages with confidence.

## CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. Understanding different types of selectors expands your ability to customize and control the appearance of your web pages. Here are some commonly used selectors:

1. Element Selector: Selects elements based on their HTML tag names. For example, to select all `<p>` elements, use the selector `p`.

2. Class Selector: Selects elements based on the value of their class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, use the selector `.classname`.

3. ID Selector: Selects a specific element based on its unique ID attribute value. To select an element with a particular ID, use the selector `#elementID`.

4. Attribute Selector: Selects elements based on their attribute values. For example, to select all elements with a specific attribute, use the selector `[attribute]`.

## CSS Properties
CSS properties define the visual appearance of selected elements. Each property has a value that determines how an element should be styled. Let's review some essential CSS properties:

1. Color: Sets the color of text and other elements using keywords, hexadecimal, or RGB values.

2. Font: Controls the typography of text, including font family, size, weight, style, and more.

3. Margin and Padding: Defines the spacing around elements. Margin creates space outside an element, while padding creates space inside an element.

4. Background: Specifies the background color or image of an element.

5. Border: Sets the border properties, including color, style, and width.

## Layout Techniques
CSS provides powerful layout techniques to control the positioning and arrangement of elements on a web page. Here are some commonly used techniques:

1. Box Model: The box model defines how elements are rendered, including content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding the box model is crucial for precise layout control.

2. Display Property: The display property determines how an element behaves in the document flow. Common values include `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`.

3. Flexbox: Flexbox is a powerful layout model that allows you to create flexible and responsive layouts. It provides a flexible way to distribute space and align elements within a container.

4. Grid Layout: CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional grid system that enables you to create complex and responsive layouts. It provides precise control over rows, columns, and their alignment.
