# A Comprehensive Review of HTML: Syntax, Structure, and Commonly Used Tags

## Introduction
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of the web. It defines the structure and layout of a web page, allowing us to create content that is accessible and interactive. In this article, we will delve into a comprehensive review of HTML, covering its syntax, structure, and commonly used tags. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer looking to refresh your HTML skills, this guide will provide you with a solid foundation.

## HTML Syntax
HTML follows a set of rules known as syntax. Understanding and adhering to these rules is crucial for creating valid HTML documents. Here are a few key aspects of HTML syntax:

1. Document Type Declaration (<!DOCTYPE>): This is the first line of an HTML document that informs the browser which version of HTML is being used.

2. Opening and Closing Tags: HTML elements are defined using opening and closing tags. The opening tag denotes the start of an element, while the closing tag marks its end. For example, `<p>` is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and `</p>` is its closing tag.

3. Nesting Elements: HTML elements can be nested within each other. It's important to ensure that nested elements are properly opened and closed to maintain the correct hierarchy.

4. Empty Elements: Some elements do not have any content and are self-closing. They are written with a single tag, such as `<br>` for line breaks or `<img>` for images.

## HTML Structure
HTML documents have a specific structure that consists of different sections. Understanding this structure helps organize the content effectively. Here's an overview:

1. Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`): This informs the browser that the document is written in HTML5.

2. HTML Element: The `<html>` element serves as the root element and encapsulates the entire HTML document.

3. Head Element: The `<head>` element contains metadata about the document, such as the page title, character encoding, and linked stylesheets or scripts.

4. Body Element: The `<body>` element encloses the visible content of the web page, including text, images, links, and other elements.

## Commonly Used HTML Tags
HTML provides a wide range of tags that enable us to structure and present content on a web page. Here are some commonly used tags:

1. `<h1>` to `<h6>`: These tags represent headings, with `<h1>` being the highest level and `<h6>` the lowest. Headings help organize content hierarchically.

2. `<p>`: The `<p>` tag is used to define paragraphs. It is commonly used for textual content.

3. `<a>`: The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks. It is used to link to other web pages, files, or sections within the same page.

4. `<img>`: This tag is used to insert images into a web page. It requires the `src` attribute, which specifies the image URL.

5. `<ul>` and `<ol>`: These tags define unordered and ordered lists, respectively. List items are enclosed within `<li>` tags.

6. `<div>` and `<span>`: These tags are generic containers that help group and style elements. `<div>` is typically used for block-level elements, while `<span>` is used for inline elements.

## Conclusion
HTML is the foundation of web development, and having a strong grasp of its syntax, structure, and commonly used tags is essential for building effective and accessible web pages. In this article, we reviewed the fundamentals of HTML, including syntax rules, document structure, and frequently used tags. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to create well-structured, semantically meaningful web pages. So, go ahead, dive into the world of HTML, and unleash your creativity on the web!
